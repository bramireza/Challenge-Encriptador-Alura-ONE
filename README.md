# About The Project

Welcome to our first encryption challenge!

During these four weeks, we will be working on an application that encrypts texts, so you can exchange secret messages with other people who know the encryption used.

## Functionality

The encryption "keys" we will be using are:

- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

### Requirements

- It must only work with lowercase letters.
- Accentuated letters or special characters should not be used.
- It must be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and return an encrypted word to its original version.

Example:

- "gato" => "gaitober"
- "gaitober" => "gato"
